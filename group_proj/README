     Airport Server

Individually, the place server and the airport server work.

However, when we combined them, we could not get the connection between
client -> place_server -> and airport_server to work.

All files reference the place_airport.h, as that has everything in
aiports.h and places.h

place_airport.x is also both airports.x and places.x

The makefile uses files from all three .x files used, but place_airport.h
is the main header file used.

Airport server is ./airports_server
Places server is  ./places_server
Client is     	  ./places_client
